USER INSTRUCTIONS:     Button functionality:      There are 6 buttons on the top left corner of the screen. By Hovering over the buttons, other buttons with functionality can be accessed. The filters in the buttons only need one click, however, many of the buttons like blueify require multiple clicks for a deeper colour.      Moving Image:      By clicking and dragging the image, the image itself can be moved to see any part of the image that is cut off from the rest due to the size of the image.
